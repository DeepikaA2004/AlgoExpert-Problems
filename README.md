## PROBLEM STATEMENTS
### I practice both JAVA and PYTHON codes for the below-given problem statements

1) Let us consider the input as abc12Abc2 if there are any numbers found in the input append the numbers alone in the front of the input and replace 0 wherever the number presence of the number occurs like 221abc00Abc0 Then if the uppercase elements are found swap the elements after swapping the element place * in the right side of the uppercase element after swapping and make the reverse process we get an actual input as output as abc12Abc2.
   
2) Write a function that takes in a non-empty array of distinct integers and an integer representing a target sum. If any two numbers in the input array sum up to the target sum, the function should return them in an array. If no two numbers sum up to the target sum, the function should return an empty array.
array=[3,5,-4,8,11,1,-1,6]
targetsum=10

3) TIME COMPLEXITY - O(N)
   SPACE COMPLEXITY- O(1)
  
   VALIDATE SUBSEQUENCE
Given two non-empty arrays of integers, write a function that determines whether the second array is a subsequence of the first one.
A subsequence of an array is a set of numbers that aren't necessarily adjacent in the array but that are in the same order as they appear 

array=[5,1,22,25,6,-1,8,10]
sequence=[1,6,-1,10]  using java

4)TIME COMPLEXITY - O(N)
SPACE COMPLEXITY - O(K)

K---> RESULT

0---->SAME TEAM ; 1---->DIFFERENT TEAM 

competitions=[["HTML", "C#"], ["C#", "PYTHON"], ["PYTHON", "HTML"]]
results=[0,0,1]
 
sample output= PYTHON 

1)C# WINS 
2)PYTHON WINS
3)PYTHON WINS 

develop a Java program for this program

5) NON CONSTRUCTABLE CHANGE
Given an array of positive integers representing the values of coins in your possession, write a function that returns the minimum amount of change (minimum sum of money)that you cannot create. The given coins have any positive integer value and aren't necessarily unique(i.e., you can have multiple coins of the same value
for example, if you're given coins = [1,2,5] the minimum amount of change that you cannot create is 4. If you're given no coins the minimum amount of change that is 1
SAMPLE INPUT : [5,7,1,1,2,3,22]
SAMPLE OUTPUT: 20
